# DAT405-
My project is based on the different temperatures around US. 
Everytime the page is refreshed a different US city appears with it's temperature.
There are also some circles labelled with the temperature of that city.
These circles change size depending on the temperature of the city.
So if the temperature is low the circle will be tiny.
Also everytime the page refreshes the city is given a color depending on their temperature.
So if the city is cold it will be a blue colour but if its hot itll be a red colour.
